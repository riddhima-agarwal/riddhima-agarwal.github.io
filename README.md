# Purpose of financial modelling

# 1. To facilitate valuation of the business
# 2. To explain business
# 3. To show path to profitability
# 4. To quantify investment requirement
# 5. To demonstrate the size of the market opportunity.

Technology has become an asset in finance: financial institutions are now evolving to technology companies rather than only staying occupied with just the financial aspect: besides the fact that technology brings about innovation the speeds and can help to gain a competitive advantage, the rate and frequency of financial transactions, together with the large data volumes, makes that financial institutions’ attention for technology has increased over the years and that technology has indeed become the main enabler in finance.



When a company wants to grow and undertake new projects or expand, it can issue stocks to raise capital. A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company and is issued in return for money. Stocks are bought and sold: buyers and sellers trade existing, previously issued shares. The price at which stocks are sold can move independent of the company’s success: the prices instead reflect supply and demand. This means that whenever a stock is considered as ‘desirable’, due to success, popularity, … the stock price will go up.
